<h1>Ravi Sagar</h1>

<p class="main-text">I am an Atlassian Consultant who help companies in adopting tools like Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, Confluence, Bamboo and Bitbucket. I have a keen interest in web development using Drupal. In 2010 I founded a Sparxsys Solutions, a software development and service company.

Apart from blogging on my blog <a href="http://www.ravisagar.in">www.ravisagar.in</a>, I have authored few books as well. My book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-jira-7-second-edition">Mastering Jira 7 - Second Edition</a> is focused on learning Jira Administrator and is based on my years of experience working on Atlassian tools.</p>
