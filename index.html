<h1>Ravi Sagar</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Ravi Sagar. I am an Atlassian Consultant, Drupal lover and technology enthusiast. This is my plain simple text only website. I wanted to create a site which is easy to maintain and doesn't use any framework. I have been developing website using Drupal for many years now. I love it but I sometimes miss working in just HTML nothing else.

On this site I will not use any images, stylesheets, javascript and will always keep it very simple. I will also not use complex layout. This site will always be accessible on all devices.</p>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>For living. I am Atlassian Consultant and loves working on Drupal.</p>
