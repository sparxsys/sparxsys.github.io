<h1>Ravi Sagar</h1>

<p class="main-text">I am an Atlassian Consultant who help companies in adopting tools like Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, Confluence, Bamboo and Bitbucket. I have a keen interest in web development using Drupal. In 2010 I founded a Sparxsys Solutions, a software development and service company.
 
  In late 2016 I moved to London to work with an Atlassian platinum partner called Valiantys. Currently enjoying life and having lots of fun (along with work of course)

Apart from blogging on my blog <a href="http://www.ravisagar.in">www.ravisagar.in</a>, I have authored few books as well. My book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-jira-7-second-edition">Mastering Jira 7 - Second Edition</a> is focused on learning Jira Administration and is based on my years of experience working on Atlassian tools.</p>
